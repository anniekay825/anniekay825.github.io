<p> Kathleen comes from a long-line of people who love to collect - connect - dots. As a life-long learner, she has a
    high sense of curiosity for many interesting topics. From true crime to coding, she always seems to find new and
    interesting things to connect – and collect – along the way.</p>
<p> Her curiosity began early as a girl scout in Manhattan, Kansas, and continued while enjoying an idyllic
    childhood in several college towns. After moving to Gainesville, FL before high school, her love of college
    football grew to an almost fanatic state (key word = almost), and she enjoyed attending and working at the
    University of Florida. </p>
<p>Kathleen brought her curiosity and keen problem solving skills to the land of pirates, princesses, and
    policies over 15 years ago. She focuses on bringing her love of learning to interns around the world to
    share how we create happiness and unforgettable moments with our Guests.</p>
<p>In 2018, Kathleen and her hubby Jack, welcomed two fun-loving fur babies to their family, and a beautiful
    grandbaby born on April 8th. Enjoying the love of travel, Kathleen & Jack, are avid cruisers and are
    excited about the vacations they have planned next year. </p>
